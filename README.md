# Plant-Growth-Calculus-Project
# 🌿 Plant Growth Analysis Using Calculus

This project studies how a plant grows and turns toward sunlight using **calculus concepts** like *rate of change (derivatives)*.

## 📘 Objective
To calculate how fast:
- The plant grows in height (cm/hour)
- The plant turns toward light (degrees/hour)

## 🧮 Concept Used
We use **numerical differentiation** (dy/dx) to find:
- Growth rate = d(height)/d(time)
- Turning rate = d(angle)/d(time)

## 🧰 Tools
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

## 📊 Output
- Plots showing plant height and turning angle over time  
- Average and maximum growth rates  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `plant_growth_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
2. Run all cells to view calculations and plots
